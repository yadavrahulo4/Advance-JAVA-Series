                      ***MULTI-THREADING***
MultiThreading in Java allows you to execute multiple threads concurrently, allowing for better utilization of resources and improved performance. Threads are lightweight processes, and Java provides built-in support for MultiThreading through the java.lang.Thread class and the java.util.concurrent package.
Here's a basic overview of how to work with multiThreading in Java:
Creating a Thread:

1)Via Extending Thread class:
Syntax:_
    class MyThread extends Thread {
        public void run() {
          // Code to be executed in the thread
   		  }
	}

2)By Implementing Runnable interface:
Syntax:_
    class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    	public void run() {
        // Code to be executed in the thread
   	   	 }
	}
Starting a Thread:

1)Using Thread class:
Syntax:_
		MyThread myThread = new MyThread();
		myThread.start(); // Starts the thread and invokes the run() method
		
2)Using Runnable interface:

		Thread thread = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
		thread.start();
		
Thread LifeCycle:
New: A thread that is created but not yet started.
Runnable: A thread that is ready to run is moved to the runnable state.
Blocked: A thread that is blocked waiting for a monitor lock.
Waiting: A thread that is waiting indefinitely for another thread to perform a particular action.
Timed Waiting: A thread that is waiting for another thread to perform a particular action for up to a specified waiting time.
Terminated: A thread that has exited.


 
		
Joining Threads:
The join() method allows one thread to wait for the completion of another. For example:
		Thread thread1 = new MyThread();
		Thread thread2 = new MyThread();
		thread1.start();
		thread2.start();
		try {
 		    thread1.join(); // Waits for thread1 to finish
		    thread2.join(); // Waits for thread2 to finish
		} catch (InterruptedException e) {
   			 e.printStackTrace();
		}
		
							***Thread Pools:***
Using ExecutorService from the java.util.concurrent package for managing and controlling threads.

		ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5); 
		// Creates a pool of 5 threads

for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    Runnable worker = new MyRunnable();
    executor.execute(worker); // Executes the Runnable in a thread from the pool
}

executor.shutdown(); // Shutdown the executor when done
This is just a brief overview, and multithreading in Java can get more complex based on your specific use case. It's important to handle synchronization carefully to avoid issues like race conditions and deadlocks.
